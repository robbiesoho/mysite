          I am self-taught, full stack web developer from New Haven, CT. I have
          experience working with frameworks such as Ruby On Rails, Express.js
          and Django. I am familiar with front-end framworks React and Vue.js. I
          have worked with different database technologies such as PostgreSQL,
          MySQL and SQLite. I have experience with industry tools such as Git,
          Heroku and AWS.

          unquencibly curious. All the projects listed are my own. For more
